# 🛡️ Women's Safety & Mental Health App

> **Empowering safety through technology** — A Java-based application with real-time location sharing, emergency phone calls via Azure Communication Services, and mental health resources.

---

## ✨ Features

### 📞 **Live Phone Calling with Location Sharing**
Share your real-time location with trusted contacts via automated phone calls. Perfect for:
- Walking home alone at night
- First dates or meeting new people
- Solo travel adventures
- Any situation where you want someone to know where you are

**How it works:**
- Enter your name and trusted contacts (phone numbers)
- Set a timeout duration (supports fractional minutes like 0.5 for quick tests!)
- Start sharing — contacts receive a **real phone call** with your message
- Location updates are logged every 10 seconds
- Auto-stops after your specified timeout

**Powered by Azure Communication Services** for real phone calls with text-to-speech message delivery.

### 🚨 **Emergency SOS**
One-tap emergency alert system that can:
- Trigger instant phone calls to your emergency contacts
- Send your current location via automated message
- Provide quick access to help when you need it most

### 💚 **Mental Health Resources**
Quick access to:
- WHO Mental Health resources
- Crisis support information
- Wellness tips and guidance

### 💪 **Motivational Support**
Rotating inspirational quotes to keep you motivated and positive throughout your day.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java JDK 17 or later** (tested with JDK 25)
- **Maven 3.6+**
- **Node.js 16+** (for webhook server)
- **Azure Communication Services account** (for real phone calls)
- Windows, macOS, or Linux

### Quick Start

#### 1. Clone and Build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Womens-Safety-App.git
cd Womens-Safety-App
mvn package
```

#### 2. Configure Azure (Optional - for real calls)
If you want real phone calls instead of demo mode:

1. Create an Azure Communication Services resource
2. Copy `azure-config.properties.example` to `src/main/resources/azure-config.properties`
3. Fill in your Azure credentials
4. See [WEBHOOK-SETUP.md](WEBHOOK-SETUP.md) for webhook configuration

#### 3. Run the Application
```bash
java -jar target/womens-safety-app-1.0.0.jar
cd Womens-Safety-App

# Compile and run in one command
& "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-25\bin\javac.exe" -d . src\Main.java; & "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-25\bin\java.exe" Main
```

#### Option 2: Standard Java Compilation
```bash
# Compile
javac src/Main.java -d .

# Run
java Main
```

## Limitations & Areas to Improve

- Azure Communications Services requires publically accessible webhook endpoints. During development, this project uses a secure tunneling service (example: ngrok) to expose a local Node.js server. In a production setting, the backend would be deployed to Azure App Service.

- Desktop vs. Mobile: For real world safety, mobile is a natural form factor. For now, we are using desktop because it's easier to debug.

- Security & Privacy: For a real deployment, we would need encryption, secure storage of contacts, clear data retention policies-- but for now, we are ignoring such factors in our prototype.
